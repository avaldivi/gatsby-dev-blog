!["Astrology and Javascript Series Banner"](/media/astrology_and_javascript_series_banner.gif)

I am absolutely excited to announce that I will be starting a live-streamed series, where I will be diving into the basics of astrology to teach people how to understand a natal chart while building a project using various front end tools within the Javascript ecosystem including React, Typescript, Remix Framework, and Styled Components and more!

Starting Tuesday March 5th, I will begin with going over the absolute foundational building blocks of astrology first:

-   In the first week we‚Äôll go over the zodiac signs, their archetypes and symbols.
    
-   The second week will go over the planets & their ruler associations within traditional and modern contexts.
    
-   The third week will focus on the concept of the houses found in a natal chart and how each zodiac sign ties into each house.
    
-   The final week will be focused on aspects or angles between the planets located in various houses.
    

If I am successful at sticking to this schedule then by mid April, I‚Äôll be moving to an API that allows me to pull data and form a natal chart. I‚Äôve reached out to a company who was willing to sponsor me as I get to this next step and they have wonderful documentation. We‚Äôll learn to use their API together.

## Who will be part of the series

I, myself will host and I am a professional Software Engineer that has a strong and passionate focus on the user interface and as long as I have been studying software engineering, I have studied Astrology through the internet, books, and workshops. To me they both require a learner‚Äôs mindset because it feels like a never ending journey of discovering. I used astrology as a self-improvement tool but it has also been very helpful for me in learning to make informed decisions. I have to credit it for allowing it to help me build my career in software engineering as well.

My hope is to invite other professional software engineers who are excited and open minded to talk about this topic while also talking about tools in the Javascript ecosystem. I also would love to extend the offer to invite professional astrologers that would also be open to the opportunity to talk about the services they offer and/or dispelling any misconceptions constantly found around astrology.

## What will we be building

The purpose of this project is to build an educational tool for learning astrology in real time. There are many if not thousands of websites that provide information of exactly what I‚Äôll be building but as an UI Engineer who loves to focus on the user experience and user interface, I want to build helpful visual tools that will give people another option for a way to learn astrology.

Educating people on astrology including helping others get into tech have been two of my favorite passions that I want to combine both into one in this series. This project has the potential to address a gap I see within the astrology community but for now this is the main focus.

We‚Äôll also be using the perspective of the Western (Tropical) astrology system. I do not think one system is better than the other whatsoever but it is the one I am most well-versed at.

## What tools will we be using

I am most experienced in React, Typescript, Styled Components, React Query. I am currently learning the Remix Framework and open to experimenting with other additional libraries and packages that will be helpful on this project.

## What to expect from this series:

-   To learn the latest in front end technologies within the Javascript ecosystem
    
-   To learn the basics of astrology to eventually learn to read your natal chart
    
-   Have the ability to ask questions about zodiac signs, planets, aspects, and houses in each respective parts of the series
    
-   Book, website, and professional Astrologer recommendations
    
-   Helpful coding tools and resource recommendations
    

This series should be a safe space to LEARN and be CURIOUS. I do not claim to be an expert at anything but I sure am open to learning. I will actually be learning more in-depth on how to use the Remix Framework.

## What NOT to expect from this series:

-   An opportunity for you to debate the validity of astrology
    
-   For me to convince you to ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in astrology
    
-   To get your natal chart read
    

You should also not use this series to replace expert consultation with a professional astrologer. There are so many wonderful astrologers who can be found within the astro community who have certifications and decades of education that can provide a thorough examination over your natal chart or other types of readings based on your needs.

## Final words

Thank you for taking the time to follow along and read the details of this upcoming series that I will be hosting. I am mostly passionate about sharing two of my favorite activities with the communities and finding people to share and exchange ideas with while encouraging others to pursue their passions within the tech space.
