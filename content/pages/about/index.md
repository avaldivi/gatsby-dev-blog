Here's a little history and current stuff I'm doing now.

![November 2022](./about.png)

I am currently a Senior _UI Engineer_ at Salesloft. I have previously worked at at an agency building various web and mobile apps in React, React Native, and Ruby on Rails and interned at MailChimp as my first full-time role while in college. I attended Georgia Gwinnett College in Lawrenceville, GA attaining a Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology with a focus of Software Development. While in college I and two other women co-founded the first Women in Technology Student Organization winning grants from NCWiT.

After college I became part of the Women Who Code Atlanta Leadership team as an _Evangelist_. I am a public speaker that shares knowledge on leadership, career, and different React related technologies. Outside of my profession and volunteer work in the Atlanta tech community, I love to discuss astrology, mental wellness, and music. I am also a mom to a 9 year old boy who you might get to know in zoom meetings!
