Last month I wrote an article about a quote I read that helped me start reflecting the past year on some obstacles I faced.

> **Try to accept the current restrictions and continue to accumulate critical mass for your personal evolutionary springboard.**

You can read about it [here](https://adriannavaldivia.dev/posts/accumulate-critical-mass-for-your-personal-evolutionary-springboard) and how we break down the quote and each respective part and it's meaning.

You might be facing some recent blockages yourself. Perhaps the job market isn't stable enough right now to find your next gig, or you are stuck on a team at work that you find hard to gel with. Maybe you are even stumped creatively and are trying to figure out how to get those creative juices flowing again. I've encountered all these obstacles and have found the situations frustrating, unable to find a way around them, at least temporarily.

I took a moment to write out and think about my strengths and weaknesses but I first I came across some questions that started to block me. What are some areas I can improve in that would allow me to see situations in a different light? How will I prioritize what's most important? It can all start to feel overwhelming. Why even start if I donâ€™t know where to begin?

Is it perhaps less important to think about where to start, and more crucial to uncover which direction to pursue? How can you know which direction to take if you haven't yet determined what's important to you?

Values are a great way to help identify what's important to you. I took the time to start reflecting on them in both my personal and professional life. To me, these areas are intertwined, and I find that my actions mirror each other in both realms. This may not be the case for you, so tread lightly as you create your own path.

## The values we have can help us determine the next step to take

1. Self-awareness
2. Community
3. Diversity
4. Curiosity
5. Leadership

### 1. Self-awareness

I ranked self-awareness as my top value because I believe it's vital to start with oneself before considering external values. Self-awareness enables us to recognize our strengths and weaknesses. Being aware of what you bring to the table and what you can learn from others eliminates much of the hard work. By identifying skills you lack or areas where you're not the strongest, you can seek the right resources to achieve your goals, rather than struggling to improve where it may not be necessary. This value also helps us stay accountable and recognize when our ego needs checking.

### 2. Community

This might be my favorite value because it quickly shows how well I will align with others. A community not only provides resources for achieving our own goals but also opportunities to connect others with their goals. You can meet people, identify their needs, and connect them with others who can help. A strong community creates a network that supports its members, fostering a space for those who might otherwise feel isolated in their interests.

### 3. Diversity

One thing I deeply value about my background, family history, area of residence, and my social and professional circles is the diversity I experience. This diversity has immensely enriched my understanding by introducing me to a wide range of perspectives.

### 4. Curiosity

If you've read this far, then you and I might share this value. To take self-awareness, community, and diversity seriously, one must be genuinely curious about all that life offers, even the aspects that aren't immediately apparent. Seeking answers means asking questions of anyone willing to respond. Discussing our frustrations with others suggests we're seeking different viewpoints. Curiosity drives us forward and fosters empathy.

### 5. Leadership

Leadership is last not because it's the least important, but because it is the culmination of the other values. **If we invest time in developing self-awareness, community, diversity, and curiosity, leadership naturally follows**. As I move into the next phase of my life, I realize that if there's anything I value most, it is guiding others on a fulfilling path of their own.
